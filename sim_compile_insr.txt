To make this lot work, you have to compile the simulator using (eg)

gcc upsim.c

Then you can copy xup.bin to a.bin:

cp xup.bin a.bin

and run the simulator; the compiler binary expects source from
standard input so the command is:

a.out <xup.x

This will produce a binary output in a file sim2.

You can copy sim2 to a.bin and compile again:

cp sim2 a.bin

a.out <xup.x

You should be able to do this over and over again with the same
result.

To see what is being compiled, you can compile xupa.x:

a.out <xupa.x

Now you can copy sim2 to a.bin and compile again:

cp sim2 a.bin

a.out <xup.x

This will produce the assembly code for the compiler,
corresponding to the code that is being executed by the
simulator.
