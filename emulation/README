DESCRIPTION OF SUBMITTED FILES
-------------------------------

network.c       A C file that contains the majority of the code
                used to create the emulation, including the
                emulated processors, the emulated network, and
                the routing algorithm. 

network.h       A header file that contains the library declarations, 
                defintions, data structures, global variables and
                function definitions used by network.c.

blur.x          An example of a parallel input program that the 
                emulation is able to execute.

compiler.x      The source code of a self compiling compiler 
                required to compile the input programs for the
                emulation. This file was provided by David May.

serial.c        A serial processor used to execute the compiler
                source. This file was provided by David May.

compiler.bin    The resulting binary of the compiler once it has
                compiled itself.

run.sh          A bash script file that allows compilation and
                execution of an input program using one command
                line instruction.
